# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

Bookline is a system designed to help libraries manage book reservations and circulation efficiently.
Users can browse the catalog, search for titles, reserve books, and join a waiting list if a book is already on loan.
When a borrowed book is returned or a reservation is canceled, the system automatically reassigns the reservation to the next user in line and sends a notification as soon as the book becomes available.
Libraries benefit from an intuitive dashboard with detailed statistics on reservations and borrowing trends, making it easier to track demand and identify the most popular books.
